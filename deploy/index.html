        <p>
            Vatnajökull National Park is one of three national parks in Iceland. It encompasses all of Vatnajökull glacier and extensive surrounding areas. These include the national parks previously existing at Skaftafell in the southwest and Jökulsárgljúfur in the north.
        </p>
        <p>
            Vatnajökull National Park was established on 7 June 2008. When established, the park covered an area of 12,000 km2, but with recent additions of Lakagígar, Langisjór, Krepputunga and Jökulsárlón (including its surrounding areas) it now covers 14,141 km2 or approximately 14% of Iceland, making it Europe's second largest national park in terms of area after Yugyd Va in Russia.
        </p>
        <p>
            The unique qualities of Vatnajökull National Park are primarily its great variety of landscape features, created by the combined forces of rivers, glacial ice, and volcanic and geothermal activity.
        </p>
        <p>
            On 5 July 2019, Vatnajökull National Park was inscribed as a World Heritage Site.

                <p>
                    Short and easy trails lead to waterfall Svartifoss and glacier Skaftafellsjökull, but for those who want to reach further out, the Morsárdalur valley and Kristínartindar mountain peaks are perfect in terms of distance and labour. Skaftafell is also the perfect base camp for those who seek to climb Iceland‘s highest mountain peak, Hvannadalshnjúkur.

                <p>
                    Private travel companies operate in Skaftafell and offer guided hikes on the nearby glaciers and mountains. Also on offer are sightseeing flights over glacier Vatnajökull and other renowned attractions.

                    In 1967, Skaftafell National Park was established, but in 2008 it became a part of the newly established Vatnajökull National Park. To enjoy Skaftafell's true value it is recommended to spend at least few days there, either staying at the camp site in Skaftafell or in a nearby accommodation.

                    <p>
                        Aurora Borealis takes its name from Aurora, the Roman goddess of dawn, and Boreas, the Greek name for the north wind. On clear, crisp winter nights in Iceland, you can experience the Northern Lights dancing magically across the sky. The Northern Lights are one of the biggest draws to visiting Iceland in the winter, the downside being that they are a natural phenomenon and thus elusive and unpredictable. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        On a yearly basis, the Lights are at their peak in September and March due to the March and September equinox. As a naturally occurring phenomenon, the appearance of the Northern Lights is notoriously difficult to predict any further in advance than about two hours before it happens. So much is dependent on solar activity and, whilst we can estimate the number of sunspots that might occur on the sun, we can accurately predict neither when they will occur nor how frequently. Once darkness falls, the Aurora can be visible at any time of day, but the optimum time seems to be around 9:30 pm to 1:00 am.

                            Icelandic nature is vulnerable. Here at the Vatnajökull National Park, we treat nature with respect, and take responsibility for our environmental impact. So we systematically aim to minimize our ecological footprint, and seek the support of our visitors to achieve that goal.

                            We recycle as much refuse as possible. Clearly labelled recycling bins are located at all main sites in the Park. You can sort your refuse and reduce its quantity by not bringing unnecessary packaging.
