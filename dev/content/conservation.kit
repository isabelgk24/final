            Icelandic nature is vulnerable. Here at the Vatnaj√∂kull National Park, we treat nature with respect, and take responsibility for our environmental impact. So we systematically aim to minimize our ecological footprint, and seek the support of our visitors to achieve that goal.

        <p>
            We recycle as much refuse as possible. Clearly labelled recycling bins are located at all main sites in the Park. You can sort your refuse and reduce its quantity by not bringing unnecessary packaging.
