            Aurora Borealis takes its name from Aurora, the Roman goddess of dawn, and Boreas, the Greek name for the north wind. On clear, crisp winter nights in Iceland, you can experience the Northern Lights dancing magically across the sky. The Northern Lights are one of the biggest draws to visiting Iceland in the winter, the downside being that they are a natural phenomenon and thus elusive and unpredictable.

            On a yearly basis, the Lights are at their peak in September and March due to the March and September equinox. As a naturally occurring phenomenon, the appearance of the Northern Lights is notoriously difficult to predict any further in advance than about two hours before it happens. So much is dependent on solar activity and, whilst we can estimate the number of sunspots that might occur on the sun, we can accurately predict neither when they will occur nor how frequently. Once darkness falls, the Aurora can be visible at any time of day, but the optimum time seems to be around 9:30 pm to 1:00 am.
